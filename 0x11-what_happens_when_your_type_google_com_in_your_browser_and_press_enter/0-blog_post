How your Browser works
When you type "google.com" into your browser, it sends a request to the DNS (Domain Name System) server to resolve the domain name "google.com" into an IP (Internet Protocol) address. The DNS server responds with the IP address of the Google server, which is where the website is hosted, once the browser has the IP address, it establishes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the Google server. This connection allows the browser to send HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests to the server and receive HTTP responses.
The browser then sends an HTTP GET request to the Google server for the homepage of the website. The Google server receives the request and processes it, generating a response that contains the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) code for the Google homepage.
The server then sends the HTML response back to the browser, which then renders the page and displays it in the browser window. The browser may also request additional resources, such as images, style sheets, and scripts, to fully render the page.
As you interact with the Google homepage, your browser may send additional HTTP requests to the server to load new content or perform other actions, such as submitting a search query. The server responds with new HTTP responses that update the page in the browser. Futhermore, A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers to ensure that the workload is balanced and there are no single points of failure. The load balancer selects a web server from a pool of available servers and forwards the request to that server.
The selected web server receives the incoming request from the load balancer and processes it. In the case of "google.com," the web server returns the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that make up the Google homepage to the browser. The web server can also perform additional tasks, such as compressing files, serving static files, or caching content to improve performance.
In some cases, the web server may forward the request to an application server, which can perform more complex tasks, such as processing a user login or running an e-commerce transaction. The application server interacts with the web server to generate dynamic content, which is then returned to the web server for delivery to the browser. The application server may also interact with a database to retrieve or store data. In the case of "google.com," the database might contain user account information, search queries, or advertising data. The application server retrieves the required data from the database and uses it to generate dynamic content for the user.
Overall, typing "google.com" in your browser triggers a series of HTTP requests and responses between your browser and the Google server, allowing you to access and interact with the Google website. #backenddeveloper #alxafrica #softwaredevelopment #devops alx_africa
