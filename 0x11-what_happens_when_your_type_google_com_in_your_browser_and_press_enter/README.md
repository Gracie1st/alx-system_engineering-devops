How your Browser works
When you type "google.com" into your browser, it sends a request to the DNS (Domain Name System) server to resolve the domain name "google.com" into an IP (Internet Protocol) address. The DNS server responds with the IP address of the Google server, which is where the website is hosted, once the browser has the IP address, it establishes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the Google server. This connection allows the browser to send HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests to the server and receive HTTP responses.
The browser then sends an HTTP GET request to the Google server for the homepage of the website. The Google server receives the request and processes it, generating a response that contains the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) code for the Google homepage.
The server then sends the HTML response back to the browser, which then renders the page and displays it in the browser window. The browser may also request additional resources, such as images, style sheets, and scripts, to fully render the page.
