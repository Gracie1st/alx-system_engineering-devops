How SSH Authenticates Users
Clients generally authenticate either using passwords (less secure and not recommended) or SSH keys, which are very secure.

Password logins are encrypted and are easy to understand for new users. However, automated bots and malicious users will often repeatedly try to authenticate to accounts that allow password-based logins, which can lead to security compromises. For this reason, we recommend always setting up SSH key-based authentication for most configurations.

SSH keys are a matching set of cryptographic keys which can be used for authentication. Each set contains a public and a private key. The public key can be shared freely without concern, while the private key must be vigilantly guarded and never exposed to anyone.

To authenticate using SSH keys, a user must have an SSH key pair on their local computer. On the remote server, the public key must be copied to a file within the user’s home directory at ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. This file contains a list of public keys, one-per-line, that are authorized to log into this account.

When a client connects to the host, wishing to use SSH key authentication, it will inform the server of this intent and will tell the server which public key to use. The server then checks its authorized_keys file for the public key, generates a random string, and encrypts it using the public key. This encrypted message can only be decrypted with the associated private key. The server will send this encrypted message to the client to test whether they actually have the associated private key.

Upon receipt of this message, the client will decrypt it using the private key and combine the random string that is revealed with a previously negotiated session ID. It then generates an MD5 hash of this value and transmits it back to the server. The server already had the original message and the session ID, so it can compare an MD5 hash generated by those values and determine that the client must have the private key.

Now that you know how SSH works, we can begin to discuss some examples to demonstrate different ways of working with SSH

Generating and Working with SSH Keys
This section will cover how to generate SSH keys on a client machine and distribute the public key to servers where they should be used. This is a good section to start with if you have not previously generated keys due to the increased security that it allows for future connections.

Generating an SSH Key Pair
Generating a new SSH public and private key pair on your local computer is the first step towards authenticating with a remote server without a password. Unless there is a good reason not to, you should always authenticate using SSH keys.

A number of cryptographic algorithms can be used to generate SSH keys, including RSA, DSA, and ECDSA. RSA keys are generally preferred and are the default key type.

To generate an RSA key pair on your local computer, type:

ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa):
This prompt allows you to choose the location to store your RSA private key. Press ENTER to leave this as the default, which will store them in the .ssh hidden directory in your user’s home directory. Leaving the default location selected will allow your SSH client to find the keys automatically.

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
The next prompt allows you to enter a passphrase of an arbitrary length to secure your private key. By default, you will have to enter any passphrase you set here every time you use the private key, as an additional security measure. Feel free to press ENTER to leave this blank if you do not want a passphrase. Keep in mind though that this will allow anyone who gains control of your private key to login to your servers.

If you choose to enter a passphrase, nothing will be displayed as you type. This is a security precaution.

Output
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
8c:e9:7c:fa:bf:c4:e5:9c:c9:b8:60:1f:fe:1c:d3:8a root@here
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+

|      o S   .    |
|     o   . * +   |
|      o + = O .  |
|       + = = +   |
|      ....Eo+    |
+-----------------+
This procedure has generated an RSA SSH key pair, located in the .ssh hidden directory within your user’s home directory. These files are:

~/.ssh/id_rsa: The private key. DO NOT SHARE THIS FILE!
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub: The associated public key. This can be shared freely without consequence.
Generate an SSH Key Pair with a Larger Number of Bits
SSH keys are 2048 bits by default. This is generally considered to be good enough for security, but you can specify a greater number of bits for a more hardened key.

To do this, include the -b argument with the number of bits you would like. Most servers support keys with a length of at least 4096 bits. Longer keys may not be accepted for DDOS protection purposes:

ssh-keygen -b 4096
If you had previously created a different key, you will be asked if you wish to overwrite your previous key:

Overwrite (y/n)?
